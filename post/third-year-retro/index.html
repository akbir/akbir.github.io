<p><strong>notes:</strong></p>
<p>I think this year I&rsquo;ll write something more intentional - not that the above isn&rsquo;t a great exercise, but it fails to encompass all that I was doing.</p>
<p>The year started slow but I went skiing again with friends - this time having 1on1 lessons with a hot Italian instructor. I&rsquo;m not sure how much this motivated me but I got significantly better at skiing for it. After which I moved to Berkeley to finish the debate paper and start on MATs.</p>
<p>I got the SuperAlignment Fellowship and the ICML best paper award; both are huge wins - and should make me feel validated in my work. Weirdly, the exact opposite happened, I spent most of March unable to do good work because I had just done something great and felt the pressure to continue upholding this. I was almost paralysed to start a new project and instead found it much easier to continue to sink time into my existing projects. I then went straight from the Debate paper to the Control project, which was a mistake - this made me very ill and involved my arm getting very infected. I had to go onto some strong antibiotics, which almost killed me.</p>
<p>I then moved back to the UK and immediately started applying for jobs. This was a 3 month process which involved lots of leetcode, interviewing with startups I didn&rsquo;t like and relearning lots of ML basics. This again made me ill about two months in. I can&rsquo;t run for that long but I did anyway. Mid this sprint, I also went to Hungary for Reka and Ago&rsquo;s wedding, where I was the maid of honour - a moment I&rsquo;m very proud of. I came back to London and in 2 weeks finished all my interviews (including 8 for Meta) before flying to California for a CAIF retreat. At the retreat I heard I got my ant offer and had a lovely weekend in SF where I met Zora.</p>
<p>After that I started immediately at Anthropic - bad decision. I should have pushed back but was keen to get into the company and see what was happening. It became an incredibly intense summer between SF and London, trying to finish MATS, PhD and get good at Anthropic (all whilst also getting ready to move). It was an intense period with Zora moving in and me trying to move out.</p>
<p>In October, I moved to SF - for 3 days for a social security interview and then to Brazil for my 30th birthday. Sadly my 2 week holiday was cut to 1 as I was desperate to get some work done for Ant (and feel of value). It was beautiful to see all my friends get along with each other, even those who had never met. It was lovely to see Audrey, Iqra and Aengus all get along so well.</p>
<p>Since then I&rsquo;ve been in SF trying to find a house and trying to settle into work. In particular, trying to understand who I want to be in this city.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also written some memorable personal blogs this year. I&rsquo;m going to just put the titles as they feel a bit too intimate to share:</p>
<ul>
<li>To Whom I Will Become</li>
<li>The Path Less Travelled, Again</li>
<li>An Ode to London</li>
<li>Rain in Berkeley</li>
</ul>
