      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alt Title: Truman goes to Glastonbury&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;After dinner with Allan Dafoe, I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking more about the simulation hypothesis and how it probably has some legs. Just as I believe that there are non-physical entities or concepts that exist (e.g., God, Love, Existence), I&amp;rsquo;ve updated my views to give the simulation idea more credence. I&amp;rsquo;m writing this more as a thought experiment than a rigorous argument, but I find it fun to explore. Watching Pantheon has also totally influenced this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>üì∑ capture your soul</title>
      <link>https://akbir.dev/post/capture-your-soul/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When my grandmother was finally persuaded to come to the UK, the biggest hurdle facing my uncle was not the visa office nor the journey, it was convincing her to have her photo taken. It goes, from (so far untractable) superstitions, that if a photo can be taken in your likeliness, a part of your soul must be captured within it. The superstition goes, that to faithfully recreate someone with such intimacy can only be done, if you were to know the person‚Äôs likeness. That for an inanimate object to capture your likeliness, it could only be in a trade; objects don‚Äôt passively observe, they capture your essence, and a toll must be taken. We told her for a British passport this was probably a fair deal. She agreed. She did, however, refuse to smile in the photo, keeping the best parts of her soul to herself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is actually a revised copy of something i wrote on March 7th 2021, before i started my PhD. It had two purposes at the time: 1) it clarified my ideas about pursuing a PhD and 2) acted as a manifesto of what i hope to achieve. Now i&amp;rsquo;m coming to the end of it, I feel comfortable with it and think it&amp;rsquo;s a good read. Enjoy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-current-situation&#34;&gt;My current situation&amp;hellip;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;As of right now my career looks something like:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>an argument for prosocial agents</title>
      <link>https://akbir.dev/post/an-argument-for-prosocial-agents/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Nov 2020 17:48:55 +0100</pubDate>
      <guid>https://akbir.dev/post/an-argument-for-prosocial-agents/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;To build machine-learning systems (agents) that are useful in the real world, they need to be able to cooperate with each other and with humans, not only at deployment but throughout their lifetime. I predicate my research on this and the following beliefs:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multi-agent deployment&lt;/strong&gt;: Transformative AI is unlikely to appear in isolation, but will instead be developed by multiple competing actors, giving rise to a large population of capable agents [1, 2].&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>history through optimisation</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;All decision tasks (questions with Yes-No answers) can be framed as optimisation tasks (minimum quantity for Yes), and as such, any problem can be considered the optimisation of some quantity. It&amp;rsquo;s an attractive, though mostly useless framework, as optimisation tasks are much harder to solve. Yet somehow we‚Äôre in a position, with advances in machine learning, where we have effective computational methods for optimisation. Thus problems in physics, anthropology and economics can be reframed as optimisations and with enough compute, could be replicated. Do I recommend we do this? Hell no. But if we want to create intelligent agents, it&amp;rsquo;s worth looking at what processes led to the most intelligent agents we know, humans.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my biggest fears is forgetting things, it&amp;rsquo;s like the beginning of dementia and the loss of self.&#xA;So when I realise that some of favourite internet moments are being slowly removed, I get unnecessarily stressed.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, recently I tried to show my friends Big Narstie on Toddla T&amp;rsquo;s BBC 1Xtra show. We simply could not find it. It&amp;rsquo;s incredibly hilarious and shows the unfiltered Narstie that I&amp;rsquo;ve come to trust. In Narstie&amp;rsquo;s defence, with his mainstream fame and Channel 4 show, I understand why some of his previous work (shout out Uncle Pain) has been removed.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For a couple of my peers and myself, covid-19 has provided a time for some introspection and with that the existential regret that we don‚Äôt really know what we‚Äôre doing here. 2 years into my career,  I‚Äôve decided to consolidate what principles I&amp;rsquo;ve learnt for the next five years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;be-kinder-to-people&#34;&gt;Be Kinder To People&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My idea of business has been profoundly influenced by pop culture. From Steve Jobs to Don Draper, those titans of industry showed me that to be successful you have to be mean, ruthless and unforgiving. This couldn&amp;rsquo;t be further from the truth. I‚Äôve only been working for 2 years, but it‚Äôs becoming more and more clear, that being kind to people really pays off. Being kind makes people want to work with you, makes you seem balanced in negotiation and helps foster long term relationships.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a bug I encountered when writing a ray-tracer in Golang and thought it was worth a quick share.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-idea&#34;&gt;The Idea&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;When rendering an image using a ray-tracer, each pixel value can theoretically be calculated independently, making parallelisation an attractive prospect.&#xA;When rendering the image, we iterate through each position and call the sample method to calculate RGB value for that pixel:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;script src=&#34;https://gist.github.com/akbir/2940ff0137aadd7c533fe326b70e855b.js&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Go makes running threads (go routines) really simple and so the idea was to split the for loop into separate threads. Where the &lt;code&gt;k&lt;/code&gt;-th thread would calculate the &lt;code&gt;[k, 2k, ... , nk]&lt;/code&gt;-th position pixels within the row.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twice in the past week i‚Äôve been asked to explain Quantum Teleportation (QT), firstly at a talk given at a research house and secondly by my tutee. I ended up asking myself plenty of questions as they went by and below wanted to write a concise explanation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;teleportation-doesnt-really-mean-what-you-think&#34;&gt;Teleportation Doesn‚Äôt Really Mean What You Think&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Quantum teleportation is a protocol for how we can communicate information with entangled quantum states. It has very little to do with our science fiction idea of teleportation ‚Äî where matter seemingly hops through space and time. Quantum teleportation concerns itself with how to send a quantum state from one person to another without physically exchanging anything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of the largest challenges when starting our company was learning how to use deep learning models in production grade software. Whilst we had solved the challenge of proving our models were capable of solving the problem with controlled environment (and nice datasets), building a pipeline and testing suite was difficult and we‚Äôd like to share what we‚Äôve learnt.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In particular, our product utilised &amp;ldquo;online learning‚Äô‚Äô, in which each model is trained specifically for a client. This makes our models vulnerable to data dependencies as well as technical dependencies.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Following on from advice from a &lt;a href=&#34;http://thinkingcomplete.blogspot.com/&#34;&gt;flatmate&lt;/a&gt;, I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôll be writing summaries of books I‚Äôve just read‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähopefully to flush out some of their ideas within my head.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Kai-Fu Lee is someone everyone should know more about. As a PhD student at Carnegie Mellon, Lee created the first speaker-independent continuous speech recognition system. As the second AI winter was settling in, Lee worked at companies such as Microsoft, Apple and even headed up Google China, witnessing the rise of Eastern and Western tech companies. After this, he headed up one of China‚Äôs most successful VC funds, Sinovation Ventures. Thus, when it comes to understanding both Silicon Valley and China‚Äôs own tech scene, fewer people have a greater understanding. Below I‚Äôve listed my favourite points from the book.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As powerful as computers have become they are still relatively &amp;ldquo;stupid&amp;rdquo;. In fact, computing &lt;em&gt;power&lt;/em&gt; normally only tells you how quickly they can perform simple calculations like adding and subtracting. What computers are really bad at is more general abstract questions. That‚Äôs stuff like &amp;ldquo;can you notice pedestrians in a photo&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;can you realise how the words &amp;lsquo;king&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;queen&amp;rsquo; are related&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What computers really get is vectors, they love them. By considering vectors as an array (list) of numbers, computers are able to still perform super simple and quick calculations. In addition, vectors already have some hardcore fans, who got obsessed with them through this niche subject called &amp;ldquo;Geometry&amp;rdquo;. These guys have come from as far as India and Greece and considered lots of ways to tell how similar vectors are (mathematicians would call these metrics).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
