      <h1>first year retrospective</h1>
      <p class="meta">October 2022</p>

      <p><strong>highlights:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Submitting CHAOS 15 minutes before the deadline</li>
        <li>Pair coding on VMAP code with Newton and Timon and being told i have "magic hands"</li>
        <li>Having drinks with Laura and then going back and hacking together the human data collection form for implicature work</li>
        <li>Lab Socials: 1) post NEURIPS dinner with Rob and Tim. Good food and a very entertaining discussion about why safety is important. 2) summer drinks with UCL dark and friends. Highlight was Ed shouting to me "Short my ass" when meeting Jesse</li>
        <li>Ice-creams on the FAIR roof in summer with Mika and the RL group</li>
        <li>UCL speaker series with Max Jaderberg - very much felt the full UCL dark energy</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>low-points:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>First meeting with Jakob to show IPD results in which the response was that I clearly had a bug in my code</li>
        <li>Stoping work on Bronson project. On the flipside, subsequent coffee with Tim and Ed was very positive. They say this is was fine but should only happen once - really appreciated their honesty and clarifying expectations</li>
        <li>Withdrawing Maestro because it needed more work / being unable to get good MultiCarRacing results</li>
        <li>Awkward conversations about paper authorship.</li>
        <li>Pushback from Buck and Co on the importance of MultiAgent Safety</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>improvements i've noticed:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>How to run a research project and the cadence required to produce results on a weekly basis.</li>
        <li>Identifying problem worth solving and if its tractable with your given approach.</li>
        <li>Approaching collaborations, organising work and what work i enjoy</li>
        <li>Worrying less about code quality for research</li>
      </ol>

      <p><strong>things I still need to learn:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li>Get better at finding papers which will have high impact.</li>
      </ol>
